When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would create a remote repository to either share the repository with someone else so they can review/contribute or just for peace of mind by knowing that I won't loss my work should my computer cease to function.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatic pulls would tend to interrupt my workflow if I'm focused on a new feature I'm adding I don't want my thought process or actions to be interrupted by some changes that those sharing my repository introduced.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are like clones, but are restricted to the GitHub environment. Normally a fork is used to create a copy of a repository with no intention of applying any local changes back to the source.
Clones are copies where you intend to update the source at some later time. Clones can be made locally from repositories on GitHub or from local repositories.
Branches are changes made to the items within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows for resolving difference between the local and the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
In the past remote collaboration might have involved mailing a copy of the file(s) back and forth and making edits and comments in the files being exchanged, or you would call someone over to your desk. Capturing comments in GitHub is certainly easier since they are stored in GitHub and viewable by all collaborators. Overall all this process is easier, but if you didn't have internet access then something like walking over to the person would be easier.
